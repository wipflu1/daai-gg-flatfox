# `Predicting flat prices` - Data Report
All information on the data used in the project is compiled in the data report in order to ensure the traceability and reproducibility of the results and to enable a systematic expansion of the database.

Typically, in the exploratory analysis of the acquired raw data, quality and other issues are identified, which require pre-processing, merging of individual datasets and feature engineering into processed datasets. Therefore, this template provides a separate section for the processed data, which then serves as a starting point for the modelling activities. This needs to be adapted to the specific project requirements.
