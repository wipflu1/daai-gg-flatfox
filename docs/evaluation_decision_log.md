# `Sample Project` - Decision Log
This protocol summarises the decisions from the evaluation of the data mining phase, which are made, for example, in a workshop together with the client and other stakeholders.

Decide:
* Do results meet user needs?
* Continuation of the project yes/no
* Planning of the deployment
* Carry out an additional data mining iteration
    * Acquire more or different data
    * Improvements in the modelling
    * Address governance issues
    * or ethical considerations
    * ...

Any presentation material created for such a workshop should also be stored in the `docs` folder.

It is important to list who was involved in the decisions and when they were made.

The structure and level of detail of this protocol should be tailored to the customs of the relevant organisation and the requirements of the decision-makers. It might include already a high level description of the envisioned product to be deployed.
