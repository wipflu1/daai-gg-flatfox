# `Flat Price Prediction Project` - Decision Log

This protocol summarizes the decisions from the evaluation of the data mining phase, which were made during a workshop with the client and other stakeholders.

## Decisions

1. **Do results meet user needs?**
   - Yes, the current model predictions are within +/- 10% of the actual flat prices when the living space area is available, meeting the user needs for accurate price estimation. This is a limitation of our model as it relies heavily on having the living space area data.

2. **Continuation of the project:**
   - Yes, the project will continue to the deployment phase.

3. **Carry out an additional data mining iteration:**
   - Yes, an additional iteration will be carried out to further improve the model:
     - **Acquire different data:** For example, proximity to water, train station, hospital, etc., to enhance model accuracy.
     - **Improvement to our sentiment analysis:** Enhance the sentiment analysis component to better understand textual descriptions and reviews.
     - **Classify and evaluate images:** Train a model to classify and evaluate the pictures uploaded with the flat listings to provide better visual assessment.
